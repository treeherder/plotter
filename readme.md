plotter, a static html generator to keep the site's theme and layout consistent for gardenplot.info.
I decided to build this tool as an aid to my first attempts at building a website, after realizing how tedious it can be to generate all of this static content by hand. 
Since I'm unfamiliar with PHP, and am launching this site on a Raspberry Pi, anyway, I figured I would just take a stab at it in python, for educational purposes.

	To Do:
		- compile list of elements for args
		- make a template for each element
		- ???
		- profit
